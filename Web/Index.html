 <h3> funky footer stuff Oh, for the first time in your life
    You're asking me for my advice
    But don't you dare think you're off the hook
    Without me taking an honest look
    You got nothing up your sleeve
    You got plenty on your mind
    And your mouth is getting dry
    Because you're yawning all the time
    And the days are getting longer
    But your patience ticks away
    And the wind could knock you over
    If the walls weren't in the way
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do?
    Oh, you've got to close your eyes
    Strike that, you've got to open them
    Oh, your thoughts are flexible
    But somehow you have broken them
    You're knocking at the door
    Like you'd rather not find out
    What is on the other side
    Because it proves beyond a doubt
    That you never had a clue
    What you wanted all along
    You attempt to hold your ground
    Like being weak is being strong
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do?
    Oh, I don't know, run outside and twirl
    Scream hello at this hyper world
    Oh, run the rooftop marathon
    Until your sense of up and down is gone
    Discover ten brand new ways
    To make tomorrow's weather like today's
    You're stuck inside a pattern.
    You're stuck inside a loop
    And you're stuck inside a pattern
    You're stuck inside a loop
    And you're stuck inside a pattern
    You're stuck inside a loop
    And you're stuck inside a pattern
    You're stuck, so take a hammer to it
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do?
    Oh, I don't know, run outside and twirl
    Scream hello at this hyper world
    I only understand myself
    Just me and nobody else
    I only understand myself
    Just me and nobody else
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    What can you do? What can you do about it?
    Oh, I don't know, run outside and twirl
    Scream hello at this hyper world
    I don't know, run outside and twirl
    Scream hello at this hyper world</h3>
